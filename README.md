# A-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Average-FuelConsumption-in-Heavy-Vehicles
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the average fuel consumption in heavy vehicles. It utilizes a dataset containing various features related to heavy vehicle characteristics to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The model is then used to predict the average fuel consumption based on the input features.

Features
Upload Heavy Vehicles Fuel Dataset: Allows users to upload the dataset containing heavy vehicle characteristics and fuel consumption data.
Read Dataset & Generate Model: Reads the uploaded dataset, preprocesses it, and generates the ANN model.
Run ANN Algorithm: Trains the ANN model using the generated dataset and displays the accuracy of the model.
Predict Average Fuel Consumption: Enables users to upload a new dataset for prediction and predicts the average fuel consumption for the given data.
Fuel Consumption Graph: Displays a graph showing the predicted fuel consumption for the vehicles in the uploaded dataset.
Requirements

Python 3.x
Libraries: tkinter, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras

Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script:

python main.py
Follow the GUI instructions to upload the dataset, generate the model, run the ANN algorithm, predict fuel consumption, and view the fuel consumption graph.
